# Assignment 1

## Overview

This assignment consists of 10 different tasks, each corresponding to one of the BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge files. There are **20 groups** (approximately 6 students per group) working on these 10 assignments, with each assignment assigned to 2 groups for cross-validation purposes.

## Group Structure

There will be **20 groups** for this assignment. Each of the 10 BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge files will be assigned to **2 groups**:

| Groups | Domain | Signature Trap | Focus | # | Target | Benchmark File |
|--------|--------|----------------|-------|---|--------|----------------|
| A1, A2 | Medicine | Indication Bias | Intervention | 46 | 460 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-A.tex |
| B1, B2 | Economics | Equilibrium Effects | Intervention | 46 | 460 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-B.tex |
| C1, C2 | Law Ethics | Attr. & Preemption | Counterfactual | 46 | 460 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-C.tex |
| D1, D2 | Sports | Outcome Bias | Counterfactual | 46 | 460 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-D.tex |
| E1, E2 | Daily Life | Regression to Mean | Association | 45 | 450 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-E.tex |
| F1, F2 | History | Survivorship Bias | Association | 45 | 450 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-F.tex |
| G1, G2 | Markets | Self-Fulfilling | Intervention | 45 | 450 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-G.tex |
| H1, H2 | Environment | Feedback Loops | Intervention | 45 | 450 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-H.tex |
| I1, I2 | AI & Tech | Goodhart's Law | Association | 45 | 450 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-I.tex |
| J1, J2 | Social Sci. | Simpson's Paradox | Association | 45 | 450 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-J.tex |
| **Total** | | | | **454** | | |

Note: Groups listed together (e.g., Groups 1 and 2) are cross-validation pairs that will swap datasets in Assignment 2.

## Group Formation

Students will form groups by selecting their preferred group assignment through a **Google Form**. The form allows students to choose which benchmark file and category they would like to work on. Each group will have approximately 6 students.

## Cross-Validation for Assignment 2

In Assignment 2, groups that worked on the same BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge file in Assignment 1 will **swap their datasets** for cross-validation. This ensures that each group validates the work of another group on the same dataset, providing robust evaluation and learning opportunities.

## Instructions

- Each group should focus on their assigned BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge file
- Review the course materials and lecture notes related to Assignment #1
- Complete the requirements specified in your assigned file
- Submit your work according to the course deadlines
