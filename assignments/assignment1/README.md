# Assignment 1

## Overview

This assignment consists of 10 different tasks, each corresponding to one of the BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge files. There are **20 groups** (approximately 6 students per group) working on these 10 assignments, with each assignment assigned to 2 groups for cross-validation purposes.

## Group Structure

There will be **20 groups** for this assignment. Each of the 10 BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge files will be assigned to **2 groups**:

| Groups | Benchmark File | Category/Domain | Example Dataset | Target Dataset |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1, 2 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-1.tex | Daily Life & Psychology (D1) | 45 | 450 |
| 3, 4 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-2.tex | History & Geopolitics (D2) | 45 | 450 |
| 5, 6 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-3.tex | Markets & Weather (D3) | 45 | 450 |
| 7, 8 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-4.tex | Disease & Recovery / Medicine (D4) | 46 | 450 |
| 9, 10 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-5.tex | Economics & Technology (D5) | 46 | 450 |
| 11, 12 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-6.tex | Environment & Climate (D6) | 45 | 450 |
| 13, 14 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-7.tex | Law, Policy & Ethics (D7) | 46 | 450 |
| 15, 16 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-8.tex | AI Safety & Alignment (D8) | 45 | 450 |
| 17, 18 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-9.tex | Performance, Evaluation & Luck (D9) | 46 | 450 |
| 19, 20 | BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge-10.tex | Social Science & Demographics (D10) | 45 | 450 |

Note: Groups listed together (e.g., Groups 1 and 2) are cross-validation pairs that will swap datasets in Assignment 2.

## Group Formation

Students will form groups by selecting their preferred group assignment through a **Google Form**. The form allows students to choose which benchmark file and category they would like to work on. Each group will have approximately 6 students.

## Cross-Validation for Assignment 2

In Assignment 2, groups that worked on the same BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge file in Assignment 1 will **swap their datasets** for cross-validation. This ensures that each group validates the work of another group on the same dataset, providing robust evaluation and learning opportunities.

## Instructions

- Each group should focus on their assigned BenchmarkT3-BucketLarge file
- Review the course materials and lecture notes related to Assignment #1
- Complete the requirements specified in your assigned file
- Submit your work according to the course deadlines
