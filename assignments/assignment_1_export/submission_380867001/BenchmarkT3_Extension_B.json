Second, it introduces Age Bias (Z2): when the retained students eventually take the 4th-grade test, they are a year older (10 vs 9).  Reading fluency correlates strongly with biological age and brain development. The result is a distorted metric where an 'older, truncated' cohort is being compared to a 'younger, full' cohort from previous years. To prove efficacy, one must control for Age (Z2) and track the cohort through 8th grade to see if the gains persist once the truncation effect fades.",

Establishing causal primacy requires comparing effect sizes through rigorous identification strategies (natural experiments, instrumental variables, cross-country comparisons with controls), not observing parallel trends. The economist's selection reflects theoretical priors - that market forces matter more than institutions - rather than evidence from the data presented. Cross-country evidence undermines the technology/globalization explanation: some countries experienced similar technological advancement and trade openness but had much smaller inequality increases, suggesting institutional factors (unions, labor law, corporate governance) may be decisive. The data is also consistent with a deeper explanation: a political-ideological shift favoring capital that simultaneously enabled globalization, shaped technology deployment, weakened unions, and cut taxes on high earners.",

(3) Scale mismatch - economic theory predicts metro-wide supply effects over years; residents experience hyperlocal dynamics over months. Research shows that while regional housing supply does moderate prices, specific neighborhoods with new luxury construction often see local rent increases.

Furthermore, index funds (Z2) are mandated to own shares based on market capitalization; since firms with higher pricing power often have higher market caps, the 'common ownership' observed is a mechanical result of fund rules rather than an intervention that 'softens' competition.

The claim assumes college 'develops valuable skills' (human capital theory), but the premium could equally reflect signaling (employers use degrees as cheap screening devices) or selection (motivated people both attend college and would earn more anyway). The growing premium (50% to 65%) could reflect credential inflation - employers increasingly requiring degrees for jobs that previously didn't need them - rather than college becoming more valuable. Without quasi-experimental variation (lottery-based scholarships, regression discontinuity at admission cutoffs), the causal effect of college itself remains uncertain.",
