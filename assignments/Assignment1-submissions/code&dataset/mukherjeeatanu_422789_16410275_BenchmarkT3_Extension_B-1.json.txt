The scenario presents three factors that all changed dramatically since 1980 - globalization, technology, AND union membership - yet the economist labels only two as 'primary causes' without justification. From the correlation evidence presented, all three are equally associated with rising inequality. Establishing causal primacy requires comparing effect sizes through rigorous identification strategies (natural experiments, instrumental variables, cross-country comparisons with controls), not observing parallel trends. The economist's selection reflects theoretical priors - that market forces matter more than institutions - rather than evidence from the data presented. Cross-country evidence undermines the technology/globalization explanation: some countries experienced similar technological advancement and trade openness but had much smaller inequality increases, suggesting institutional factors (unions, labor law, corporate governance) may be decisive. The data is also consistent with a deeper explanation: a political-ideological shift favoring capital that simultaneously enabled globalization, shaped technology deployment, weakened unions, and cut taxes on high earners.",

(3) Scale mismatch - economic theory predicts metro-wide supply effects over years; residents experience hyperlocal dynamics over months. Research shows that while regional housing supply does moderate prices, specific neighborhoods with new luxury construction often see local rent increases.

At 40%, the 'Duck Curve' could deepen: the marginal value of additional mid-day solar drops toward zero, while the marginal cost of providing reliable evening power (via batteries or gas peakers) could rises sharply.
